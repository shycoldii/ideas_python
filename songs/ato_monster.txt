[Verse 1]
I used to be a hurricane
Tell you how that really feel
Show you all that I destroyed
I grew up around the fucking way
I know you ain’t really real
I can feel that when you smile
I don’t care where you’re from
But what you see when you close your eyes
Strangers used to be your friends
They might still be if you didn’t care
Oh, I've been here before
Had to check myself to make sure

The feeling still pain
My people in a hurry
My people tryna grab at the change
Stopped looking both ways
When I saw one side is a mirror
And the world is a stage
Fuck you and your games
Are you not entertained
This was never what I pictured
I’m alone in the fray
Putting people first who couldn’t say my last name
Letting people hurt, tryna test my faith like ay
Run gone
Tell my brothers, run on
That fight was for me
I’ma keep moving in my sleep till I wake from this dream
And reflect what I see

Is she worse for lying
Or me for believing
Lost Genesis, Lord I lost my freedom
Grew up in conflict
Looking for appeasement
Used to draw the light and sell it to the evening
These days we choose to judge by the preview
Sometimes getting too close
They don’t see you
Shame on him for forgetting what we’ve been through
Shame on me for thinking I need you
Find me in the shadows of the city
Sunset falls behind the skyline
Carry the words you said to me
In case I’m in need of a lifeline

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk to the end of that thought and press the glass
Beyond this life and over Mars
Behind the canvas that holds the stars
The pale blue dot that’ll hold your heart
Behind the pretty faces, behind the egos
Behind the paper and the makeshift
Finally find yourself and can’t face it
So frustrating, lost conversations
Afraid to be wrong, that's why I never grew
That’s why this for me even if I say you
That’s why this for me even if I say her
That’s why this for me even if I say him
I don’t know why, sometimes I look for your face in the sky
More time I push them away
I write cos I never used to know how to say it

[Chorus]
It’s just how I feel right now
I don’t really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
It’s just how I feel right now
I don’t really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear

[Verse 2]
Mean it
Told you that I love you, didn’t mean it
Everybody here wants the feeling
Let it fill the room to the ceiling
No one really being, keeping up an appearance
Let down my dearest
Shame is what I needed
Took her to the Eiffel, tryna change her view
You gave her the city but she looking at you
I’m still tryna know myself
Know my path
Cos when you lead the way
That journey's dark
I had to shed some light on my past
I had to change the clocks before
My first alarm, I told them

The last supper
Take time, it’s been a cold summer
Ooh, they wanna talk about karma
How could I wish pain on another
This film's a thriller
Sinners act as the pillars
Looking for my view
Brother you ain't supposed to miss the end
All the things that I wrote I writ in pen
You can visit them again and again
So busy talking about me
You abandoned yourself
It’s just funny that you’d ask me for help
It’s just another story left on the shelf
We so, insecure
Look for more
Life’s too short
To step into your 44’s
I mean we’re young
No idea what we’ve got in store
Both afraid to write first
Till we fade to thoughts

[Pre-Chorus]
To the end of that thought and press the glass
Beyond this life and over Mars
Behind the canvas that holds the stars
The pale blue dot that’ll hold your heart
Behind the pretty faces, behind the egos
Behind the paper and the makeshift
Finally find yourself and can’t face it
So frustrating, lost conversations
Afraid to be wrong, that's why I never grew
That’s why this for me even if I say you
That’s why this for me even if I say her
That’s why this for me even if I say him
I don’t know why, sometimes I look for your face in the sky
More time I push them away
I write cos I never used to know how to say it

[Chorus]
It’s just how I feel right now
I don’t really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
It’s just how I feel right now
I don’t really know much else
People come and people go
But I need you here I swear
